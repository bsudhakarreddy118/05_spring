    Data Persistence
    ----------------
    files, Databases
    
    DBMS - Database Management systems
        - is a software which is used to effeciently store and manage data (CRUD) CREATE- RETRIEVE, UPDATE, DELETE
        
    RDBMS - Relational DBMS
    
        - based on relational theory - E.F.Codd
        - Data is stored as tupple
        - stored in Table as row and columns
        
        Table is a collection of related Data
        - Each row has columns/attribute for a single instance of the relation - tuple
        - each tuple is identified by a key - primary key (unique)
        - Relational Constraints
            - Primary constraint
            - Not Null constraint
            - Domain constraint (check constraints) - allowed values in a column
            - Unique constraints
            - referential constraints - foreign key
            
      Relations
         1-M  - Customer - Orders
         M-1  - Orders - Customer
         M-N  - Student - Course 
         1-1  - Employee - Passport
         
         
     SQL - Structured Query Language
      - language use to inteact with RDBMS DB
      - DDL 
        - Data Defn Language
            - create Databases, Tables etc
      - DML  
        - Data Manipulation Language
            - Querying and managing data
            - CRUD
      - DCL 
        - Data Control Language
            Granting permission
        
        
       Databases
            - MS Access,SQL server - Microsoft, 
            - MySQL
            - Oracle
            - DB2, postgress ...
        
        
       MySQL - community edition server + GUI Workbench
